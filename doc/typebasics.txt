There are four basic types:

num - Any number
bool - true or false
string - any arangement of letters, numbers, or symbols
functions - these can be passed as variables and are a type

There are also two built-in data structures built into the core:

arrays - contiguous memory, can be any of the data types
lists - noncontigous memory, no random lookups, can be of any data types

Additionally, there will be structures. They can hold any arrangement of other types and structures. They must be declared in a separate file.
