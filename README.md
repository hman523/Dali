# Dali Language
## A language so abstract it's surreal


## Purpose
There's really no need for this language. It does nothing truely unique. This is more for me to learn how to write a compiler and a language.

## Notice
So I started this project with very little knowledge on compiler theory. I decided it would be best to put this project to the side and work on it later once I have a better idea of how to implement my idea. In the meantime, I am working on my interpretted language Monet which you can check out on my GitHub.
